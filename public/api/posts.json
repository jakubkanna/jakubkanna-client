Among these nominations, the international jury selects the best work, which is&nbsp;awarded the main prize of&nbsp;PLN 20,000, sponsored by&nbsp;the Minister of&nbsp;Culture and National Heritage. Additionally, the visiting public has the opportunity to&nbsp;cast their votes for their favorite piece during the exhibition.</p>\n<p>New media encompass a&nbsp;diverse range of&nbsp;genres, constructing artworks that engage with phenomena and tools stemming from the advancements in&nbsp;technology, communication, and imaging.</p>\n<p>The 10th edition of&nbsp;the exhibition, this year themed Threshold, encapsulates the latest artworks as a&nbsp;space for reflection, a&nbsp;point of&nbsp;departure, and a&nbsp;realm of&nbsp;transgression, confrontation, and tension between realms. The term &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; also symbolizes the transition into artistic adulthood, signifying the departure from the confines of&nbsp;the academy, fostering self-reflection, and shaping one&rsquo;s artistic identity.</p>\n<p>This word, in&nbsp;various contexts, materially and metaphorically, opens a&nbsp;wide range of&nbsp;meanings, indicating, however, in a&nbsp;process-oriented situation &ndash; change. From crossing a&nbsp;threshold, carrying across a&nbsp;threshold, not greeting over a&nbsp;threshold, thresholds on a&nbsp;fluke, thresholds of&nbsp;pain, thresholds in a&nbsp;river, poverty thresholds, to&nbsp;subliminal messages and psychological thresholds.</p>\n<p>Staying on&nbsp;the threshold for a&nbsp;while, one can experience discomfort mixed with excitement. It is&nbsp;this intensity of&nbsp;sensation that conditions one to&nbsp;touch a&nbsp;borderline place. Here one can consciously decide whether to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;the familiar or go&nbsp;beyond. We&nbsp;morph as we&nbsp;are shaped by&nbsp;new conditions, and our presence beyond the threshold, changes the environment, which also begins to&nbsp;undergo redefinition.</p>\n<p>In this edition of&nbsp;the Competition, the works on&nbsp;display will include impression installations, video games and installations, 3d animations, publications, sculptural objects, and performative actions. Creative and critical insights will be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;the multifaceted actions and installations, both drawing on&nbsp;natural elements and using artificial intelligence. The diversity highlights the growing importance of&nbsp;media tools within contemporary art and their role in&nbsp;shaping reflections on&nbsp;the present.</p>\n<p>In Adela Gorna&rsquo;s animation Inner Room, we traverse the boundary between the imaginary and the real, navigating the inner and outer dimensions of ourselves. Jakub Kanna&rsquo;s installation Fight or Flight physically challenges the limits of endurance, triggering adrenaline rushes and elevating our perception to new heights. Matthew Zubel&rsquo;s game Intruder pushes us out of our comfort zones, offering insight into the complexities of dementia, including memory loss.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"},{"images":[{"etag":"78adca9428b3e7d1a36cde049131a368","mediaType":"IMAGE","public_id":"GOPR0789-1","cld_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dzsehmvrr/image/upload/v1736004891/GOPR0789-1.jpg","path":"/home/host797681/labguy-server/public/uploads/images/GOPR0789-1.jpg","filename":"GOPR0789-1","format":"jpg","bytes":604732,"description":"","width":3840,"height":2880,"isBright":true,"createdAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:51.000Z","updatedAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:52.553Z"},{"etag":"98f9a4747240c1fe26d14eba7b5a5dfd","mediaType":"IMAGE","public_id":"GOPR0755-1","cld_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dzsehmvrr/image/upload/v1736004891/GOPR0755-1.jpg","path":"/home/host797681/labguy-server/public/uploads/images/GOPR0755-1.jpg","filename":"GOPR0755-1","format":"jpg","bytes":405368,"description":"","width":2880,"height":3840,"isBright":true,"createdAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:51.000Z","updatedAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:52.587Z"},{"etag":"4f3a1d0e781292af430cf53e2ac7a6e7","mediaType":"IMAGE","public_id":"GOPR0757-1","cld_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dzsehmvrr/image/upload/v1736004891/GOPR0757-1.jpg","path":"/home/host797681/labguy-server/public/uploads/images/GOPR0757-1.jpg","filename":"GOPR0757-1","format":"jpg","bytes":422521,"description":"","width":2880,"height":3840,"isBright":true,"createdAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:51.000Z","updatedAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:52.475Z"},{"etag":"cde4b4dca087431f5e6fd08170fc98c8","mediaType":"IMAGE","public_id":"GOPR0758-1","cld_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dzsehmvrr/image/upload/v1736004891/GOPR0758-1.jpg","path":"/home/host797681/labguy-server/public/uploads/images/GOPR0758-1.jpg","filename":"GOPR0758-1","format":"jpg","bytes":394062,"description":"","width":2880,"height":3840,"isBright":true,"createdAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:51.000Z","updatedAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:52.272Z"},{"etag":"3820035b8561a7fc58c106f418f24046","mediaType":"IMAGE","public_id":"GOPR0752-1","cld_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dzsehmvrr/image/upload/v1736004892/GOPR0752-1.jpg","path":"/home/host797681/labguy-server/public/uploads/images/GOPR0752-1.jpg","filename":"GOPR0752-1","format":"jpg","bytes":637086,"description":"","width":2880,"height":3840,"isBright":true,"createdAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:52.000Z","updatedAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:52.555Z"},{"etag":"da388ee6ae06b63b7064c6f2b2e9b71b","mediaType":"IMAGE","public_id":"GOPR0774-1","cld_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dzsehmvrr/image/upload/v1736004891/GOPR0774-1.jpg","path":"/home/host797681/labguy-server/public/uploads/images/GOPR0774-1.jpg","filename":"GOPR0774-1","format":"jpg","bytes":839065,"description":"","width":2880,"height":3840,"isBright":true,"createdAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:51.000Z","updatedAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:52.346Z"},{"etag":"85abc5d6e41e10663ce0236b729b54bd","mediaType":"IMAGE","public_id":"GOPR0776-1","cld_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dzsehmvrr/image/upload/v1736004891/GOPR0776-1.jpg","path":"/home/host797681/labguy-server/public/uploads/images/GOPR0776-1.jpg","filename":"GOPR0776-1","format":"jpg","bytes":778537,"description":"","width":2880,"height":3840,"isBright":true,"createdAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:51.000Z","updatedAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:52.518Z"},{"etag":"acde9b1814b954fe76954afcfcd3b4a5","mediaType":"IMAGE","public_id":"GOPR0769-1","cld_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dzsehmvrr/image/upload/v1736004891/GOPR0769-1.jpg","path":"/home/host797681/labguy-server/public/uploads/images/GOPR0769-1.jpg","filename":"GOPR0769-1","format":"jpg","bytes":762008,"description":"","width":2880,"height":3840,"isBright":true,"createdAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:51.000Z","updatedAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:52.466Z"},{"etag":"0036b2efb95d20241eb9567cd4a6c490","mediaType":"IMAGE","public_id":"GOPR0778-1","cld_url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dzsehmvrr/image/upload/v1736004891/GOPR0778-1.jpg","path":"/home/host797681/labguy-server/public/uploads/images/GOPR0778-1.jpg","filename":"GOPR0778-1","format":"jpg","bytes":484241,"description":"","width":2880,"height":3840,"isBright":true,"createdAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:51.000Z","updatedAt":"2025-01-04T15:34:52.463Z"}]}],"generalId":64,"authorEmail":"hello.jakubkanna@gmail.com","general":{"id":64,"title":"F.O.F.

Today it is often used as a collective mark of various types of circumstances linked to the vehicles with one and more wheels powered by muscles.</p>\n<p id=\"velo-columns\">Bicycles started to appear in the history of art a long time ago.

Thus where is the place for freedom in the world where the tiniest thing has been defined or on the another hand what would a zebra crossing with no straps be? No one ever said that art has to challenge the world through seriousness. It unfortunately leads to the definition of contemporary art; for example &ndash; the Bicycle Wheel designer &ndash; M. Duchamp&rsquo;s &bdquo;If I Call It Art, It&rsquo;s Art&rdquo;. Does it seem to keep us in a single place for years now or it allows us to breath the way we want to?

Our world today can be characterized as one of continuous crisis and uncertainty, from the COVID pandemic to increasing environmental collapse, from war in Ukraine and elsewhere to the ongoing physical and symbolic violence brought about through the intersection of economic, geopolitical, gendered, sexual, and racial injustice. Given this crisis, there is a tendency to look for new heroes who would simply save us from the problems of today. Yet it is precisely this heroic &ldquo;monomyth&rdquo;, the idea that all problems are personal and they&rsquo;re all solvable by a singular, dramatic individual, that has distracted us from the possibility of deeper, broader change or of holding accountable the powerful who create and benefit from the status quo and its myriad forms of harm. The artists in the exhibition &ldquo;Absence of Protagonists&rdquo; contest these simplified conceptions of identity and agency, addressing feelings of disillusionment, confusion, and disharmony to destabilize the fantasies of a singular saviour and its imbrication in the harmful myths of our contemporary era. The systems that we struggle against in the contemporary world, that MUST be struggled against, will not be brought down by a lone hero. Refusing to be seduced by toxic subjectivities and the lure of personality, these artists use a variety of media and formal strategies to make visible and confront the problems of today, and to imagine new narrative forms and ways of living and being in our time of chaos. The very absence of protagonists, antagonists, and simple plots curiously brings the individuals to the forefront, displaying the intricate complexity, mundanity, and subjectivity that make us all who we are.<br>&ndash; Post

But, I still like the fact they are there, perversely it calms me down.</p>\n<p>No, it&rsquo;s not about the fact they&rsquo;re open on Sundays. I am barely able to pick something to buy there. But whenever I come back home late I feel better just knowing that there are people. I follow the path of shiny, green dots. I connect them.</p>\n<p>These little Żabka shops are for me one of a mini-metaphor of safety, some kind of s certainty zone. With little impact on so many things you appreciate or simply notice small repetitive, constant elements of reality. I&rsquo;m interested in modes, objects, or micro-rituals, which provide peace in the areas we can control.</p>\n<p>Small warranties, building blocks of comfort zones.<br>Let&rsquo;s see the work of artists, who signed up to participate in the exhibition about safety, its lack, effective building, or incantation. All in Minecraft, and even in the shop around the corner.</p>\n<p>Jagna Domżalska</p>"},{"videos":[{"etag":"V9yMVy__-kGXIP5oXavz5N7fLM0","mediaType":"VIDEO","public_id":"it_SBfwg_II","vimeo_url":null,"sc_url":null,"yt_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it_SBfwg_II","title":"ZIELONE ŚWIATŁO / GREEN LIGHT - The Guardian","duration":"PT1M53S","definition":"hd","description":"Copyright © 2020 Jakub Kanna","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/it_SBfwg_II/hqdefault.jpg","player_loop":true,"player_muted":false,"createdAt":"2024-12-28T10:58:00.871Z","updatedAt":"2024-12-28T10:58:00.871Z"}]},{"text":"<p>Artists: Kinga Bartniak, Katarzyna Borelowska, Ben Hall, Ilia Meier, Jakub Trzciński</p>\n<p>Curator: Jagna Domżalska</p>\n<p>Coordinators: Nikodem Biegowski, Wiktor Gruszka, Jakub Kosecki, Julianna Kulczyńska, Mikołaj Torz, Olga Truszkowska</p>\n<p>The experience of &ldquo;Green Light&rdquo; exhibition is possible via LUKA 5G server on&nbsp;Minecraft platform or&nbsp;via facebook.

class=\"wp-block-heading\">Journal I &ndash; DJ ALEPH &ndash; DRONES OVER ANTARCTICA</h2>\n<p><em>17:16, the twenty-fourth day of January, 2022, L&aacute;dv&iacute;, Prague.</em></p>\n<p>Yesterday, on my way to the store, I learned that Prague has a very similar level of sunlight as the United Kingdom. I believed it without hesitation; you can strongly feel it here. On the concrete sidewalk surrounded by a post-socialist view, one of my shoes, soaked in black melted snow (only on the outside, inside is protected by a Gore-Tex layer), came up with an idea. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we try to break this monotonous art/world grayness? Are we satisfied enough with the state of reality to accept it? Why do we, as creators of the current 21st-century reality, have the audacity to expect a guarantee of balanced survival? The time of being bored with boredom has finally come. It&rsquo;s time to create the possibility of fulfillment for the many expectations built by contemporary art/world1!!!!!!!!! (A term describing both the concept of the world and art. It assumes that they constitute an integral whole) &ndash; HEY! WAKE UP! HEY! WAKE UP! HEY! WAKE UP! HEY! WAKE UP! HEY! WAKE UP! HEY! WAKE UP! &ndash; a robotic sound of TeamSpeak, saturated with the rhythmic pounding of DJ ALEPH&rsquo;s track &ndash; DRONES OVER ANTARCTICA. &ndash; Apparently, one of my friends is demanding, in a way filled with &ldquo;playfulness&rdquo; (playfulness combined with mischief tolerated by both sides), a return to playing CS 1.6. In the course of all these thoughts, I no longer know &ldquo;where to put my hands&rdquo; together with you, and if all of this is really necessary &ldquo;for real.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Journal II &ndash; Blue Hour &ndash; Midnight Sun (Dj Ibons Never Mind Mix) [BLUEHOURMXSPL001]</h2>\n<p><em>23:26, the ninth day of February, 2023, Wilda, Poznań.</em></p>\n<p>The Wi-Fi doesn&rsquo;t work well in the bedroom, so I have to move to another room to continue writing in Google Docs. I turned off the light to avoid paranormal numbers on the bill and walked through the dark kitchen to the living room, holding the laptop in my arms like a child. But before I sat down (yes, I know, I overuse the word &ldquo;however&rdquo;) on the writing chair, covered in shadows, I looked out the window with a gaze seeking help. A playground. A swing. It&rsquo;s moving. There&rsquo;s no child on it anymore. I&rsquo;ve seen him before. How old can that guy be, 16? What is he doing? Swinging. Dynamically and rhythmically. A full swing sequence lasts about 3 seconds. The maximum height threshold he reaches is within the norm but closer to its limit. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s nervousness or rather joy. It&rsquo;s quite late and too cold to be swinging. So there must be some motivation driving him. Alright. I don&rsquo;t think he has got an easy life. Hmm. What if this swinging could take on a creative form? Later, more than just creative. From a problem to creation. Wait, what if he doesn&rsquo;t have a problem and he&rsquo;s just there to practice swinging? I don&rsquo;t see a swing suit, so is it even swinging? What if swinging is something for him that I don&rsquo;t actually know about? I don&rsquo;t want to know. It&rsquo;s his swing now. I&rsquo;ll just silently cheer for him.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Journal III &ndash; SPLASHH &ndash; All I Wanna Do</h2>\n<p><em>13:13, thirteenth day of September, 2013, somewhere in the forest, Stary Gieląd.</em></p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything interesting to share in this part. You can skip it if you want. You can also keep reading; I don&rsquo;t know what sentence I&rsquo;ll write next. I didn&rsquo;t do any research. I no longer find personal confessions interesting. I didn&rsquo;t create a nice documentation. I won&rsquo;t write an interesting biography. I won&rsquo;t write a description. I won&rsquo;t protest. I won&rsquo;t call it Untitled. I won&rsquo;t learn anything new. I won&rsquo;t try to change anything. I didn&rsquo;t plan anything. I won&rsquo;t introduce myself. I don&rsquo;t care about networking, nor diving. I won&rsquo;t sell this. I won&rsquo;t be controversial. You won&rsquo;t see a nice object on a white background either. I won&rsquo;t do a good job. I like climbing, so might go. I won&rsquo;t continue writing this any longer; I&rsquo;ll let GPT handle it: &ldquo;Sure, I can do that. Here&rsquo;s a sentence for you: GPT is a powerful tool for generating human-like language, and it has been used in a wide range of applications, from chatbots and virtual assistants to creative writing and academic research.&rdquo; Okay&hellip; I&rsquo;ll resign from using GPT&hellip; I won&rsquo;t call myself an artist, nor call this discourse art. I won&rsquo;t call it postmodernism. I&rsquo;ll call it trivialism. Isn&rsquo;t life as a human trivial? Fragile, falling in love, sniffing&hellip; &ndash; I have to censor this because it will be included in my master&rsquo;s thesis. &ndash; Dancing to the sunrise, driven by dreams, trying to survive, adapting to the economic system we currently live in. Making mistakes. Listening to surf rock, not techno. Forced to pretend that what he created is something more than it really is. Answering his parents&rsquo; questions about the future, which may change after a head-on collision with an oncoming car in the shape of a smiling hot dog. All to get to work, which in 20 years could be done casually, with a touch of something that replaces the mouse. Sitting in a comfortable metal box with four wheels, abusing the horn, which was designed as a signal of danger, not discharged anger. Abusing the word &ldquo;art,&rdquo; which no longer means anything. A human who exploded like a tire of an overloaded Nutella transport truck.
